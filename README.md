# Coronavirus Reverse Engineering

The idea of this repo is to compile as much information as possible about the the coronavirus family, 
in particular about SARS-CoV-2. This includes genome sequences, protein structures and other resources available online.

Initial exploratory analysis it's on the root [notebook](./coronaversing.ipynb) from where we branch to other aspects of the virus.
