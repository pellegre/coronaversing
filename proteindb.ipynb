    "\n",
    "In a previous [notebook](./coronaversing.ipynb) we did an exploratory analysis of the data we collected from online sources and created a database of regions for each genome. The portions of the genome for each sample is classified into 3 types: ORF (a potential coding frame), UTR (untranslated regions at the 5' and 3' ends of the genome) and ING (intergenic region, located between 2 ORFs). Each portion has a label assigned, for example an UTR region could be \"3UTR\" or \"5UTR\" and ORFs could be \"S\", \"N\" or \"ORF1ab\", and so on, depending on which protein is codifying. The idea is to have a standardized mechanism to access regions of the genome common to all coronavirus samples to perform large scale analysis efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the labels for each region are left \"undefined\", since we need to execute a detailed analysis of each frame to recognize what is coding for. For example, given a coronavirus genome and the list of ORFs, how do we know which one is the ORF1a and how to join it with ORF1b to get ORF1ab? These are (usually) the first two ORFs that combined make up two thirds of the genome. Joining them it's tricker, since we have to locate the slippery sequence and perform a -1 frame shift. Sometimes there is an ORF in the 5'UTR region and the \"untranslated region\" now becomes potentially translatable. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know where the structural proteins coding segment are? Coronaviruses encode three conserved membrane-associated proteins that are incorporated in virions: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and a nucleoprotein (N). These four proteins seems to occur in the order S–E–M–N but between those genes, there are species-specific accessory proteins. How do we recognize these and find common sequences to classify them within a specie?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the details that we have to figure out.\n",

    "As you might guess, ORF@00265 and ORF@13767 are ORF1a (\\~13.2kbp) and ORF1b (\\~7.7kpb). Ideally, we would like to remove ORF1b from our database and replace it with ORF1ab, since that is consistent to what happens in reality : the first gene is translated as ORFs 1a and 1ab, with 1ab resulting from a pseudoknot-induced -1 ribosomal frame shifting event at a slippery sequence of UUUAAAC at the ORF1a/ORF1b junction, which we will have to find to get the correct aminoacid sequence of the 1ab polyprotein which it's around ~21kbp.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first open reading frame ORF@21535 downstream ORF1ab encodes the spike (S) glycoprotein and the size it's around ~3.8 kbps. E, M and N are encoded by ORF@26244, ORF@26522 and ORF@28273 respectively. We know this because the genbank [entry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512.2) at NCBI contains annotations with the name of each CDS. This annotations aren't always available, so we should develop a method to generically tag each coding region with the protein it codifies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the polyprotein and the structural proteins there are a few other coding segments which we are going to deal later.\n",

    "By looking at ORF1 on the sample above, seems natural to apply the following algorithm over our entire database.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find the 2 biggest ORFs on the genome. The bigger one is ORF1a and the other is ORF1b.\n",
    "* Whatever it's on the left of ORF1a it's 5UTR (regardless if there are any additional ORFs on that region).\n",
    "* We have to find the slippery sequence near the end of ORF1a and perform the frame shift to get the aminoacid sequence of ORF1ab. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before going there, let's plot the distribution of the biggest ORF for each genome to spot for anomalies."
